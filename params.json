{"note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","tagline":"Spark is a javascript framework that lets you develop applications in javascript like you weren't in a browser. No html, except a simple (really simple) template file where the javascript is injected. Then, you just code in javascript. That's it really. Not another AJAX framework. Just a way to write web apps in pure JavaScript. It does include a AJAX abstraction though.","name":"Spark","google":"","body":"# Spark.js \r\n\r\n## What is Spark.js?\r\n\r\nSpark.js is a JavaScript Framework designed to make writing JavaScript on the client-side like writing a desktop application. With Spark.js, you can write HTML from JavaScript, so removing the middleman from your JavaScript and your HTML.\r\n\r\n## Why use Spark.js?\r\n\r\nSpark.js is very clean, in that the code is self descriptive, and doesn't require unnecessary characters. For example, in jQuery you do this to make a button with JavaScript:\r\n```HTML\r\n<!doctype html>\r\n<html>\r\n<body id=\"body\">\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script>\r\nfunction test(){\r\n  alert(\"Hi\")\r\n}\r\n$(document).ready(function() {\r\n$(\"#body\").html(\"<button type=\\\"submit\\\" onclick=\\\"test()\\\">Test</button>\")\r\n})\r\n</script>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot bad right? You could even put the JavaScript in a seperate file, and load that file, so you could then write almost all of your HTML in JavaScript. That might look like this:\r\n```HTML\r\n<!doctype html>\r\n<html>\r\n<body id=\"body\">\r\n<script src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script>\r\nfunction test(){\r\n  alert(\"Hi\")\r\n}\r\n$(document).ready(function() {\r\n$(\"#body\").html(\"<form method=\\\"POST\\\"><input type=\\\"text\\\" /><button type=\\\"submit\\\">Submit</button>\")\r\n})\r\n</script>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\nBut at that point, even if the JavaScript is in a seperate file, it's even more complex than just writing the HTML, because everything is on one line, \r\nyou have to put a backslash before quotes, ect. In Spark however, making a button looks like this:\r\n```HTML\r\n<!doctype html>\r\n<html>\r\n<body id=\"body\">\r\n<script src=\"/spark.js\"></script>\r\n<script>\r\nfunction test() {\r\nalert(\"Hi\")\r\n}\r\nSpark.create('button', {'type': 'submit', 'onclick': 'test()'}, 'Test')\r\n</script>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\nIf you were to put the JavaScript in a seperate file, you can see how much that is like writing a desktop application.\r\n\r\nSpark works in Chrome and Firefox, but not IE. I'm working on IE support\r\n\r\n## Awesome! Where can I get it?\r\nWe are hosted on GitHub [here](https://github.com/PyScripter255/Spark). \r\nDownload Links:\r\n[zip](https://github.com/PyScripter255/Spark/zipball/master)\r\n[tarball](https://github.com/PyScripter255/Spark/tarball/master)\r\n\r\n## How can I help!\r\n\r\nI thought we already said that it's on GitHub! Just fork the repo, and send pull requests once you have added features or fixed bugs.\r\n\r\n## Wait... What licensing do I have to deal with?\r\n\r\nNone! Spark.js is public domain! Just pop it in your project and get going!"}
