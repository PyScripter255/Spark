{"tagline":"HTML in JavaScript","body":"# Spark.js\r\n## What is Spark.js?\r\nA JavaScript framework that lets you write HTML from JavaScript.\r\n\r\n## Why use Spark.js?\r\n\r\nSpark.js is very clean, in that the code is self descriptive, and doesn't require unnecessary characters. For example, in jQuery you do this to make a button with JavaScript:\r\n```HTML\r\n<!doctype html>\r\n<html>\r\n<body id=\"body\">\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script>\r\nfunction test(){\r\n  alert(\"Hi\")\r\n}\r\n$(document).ready(function() {\r\n$(\"#body\").html(\"<button type=\\\"submit\\\" onclick=\\\"test()\\\">Test</button>\")\r\n})\r\n</script>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot bad right? You could even put the JavaScript in a seperate file, and load that file, so you could then write almost all of your HTML in JavaScript. That might look like this:\r\n```HTML\r\n<!doctype html>\r\n<html>\r\n<body id=\"body\">\r\n<script src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script>\r\nfunction test(){\r\n  alert(\"Hi\")\r\n}\r\n$(document).ready(function() {\r\n$(\"#body\").html(\"<form method=\\\"POST\\\"><input type=\\\"text\\\" /><button type=\\\"submit\\\">Submit</button>\")\r\n})\r\n</script>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\nBut at that point, even if the JavaScript is in a seperate file, it's even more complex than just writing the HTML, because everything is on one line, \r\nyou have to put a backslash before quotes, etc. In Spark however, making a button looks like this:\r\n```HTML\r\n<!doctype html>\r\n<html>\r\n<body id=\"body\">\r\n<script src=\"/spark.js\"></script>\r\n<script>\r\nfunction test() {\r\nalert(\"Hi\")\r\n}\r\nSpark.create('button', {'type': 'submit', 'onclick': 'test()'}, 'Test')\r\n</script>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\nIf you were to put the JavaScript in a seperate file, you can see how much that is like writing a desktop application.\r\n\r\nSpark works in Chrome and Firefox, and IE.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How can I help!\r\n\r\nIt's on GitHub!
